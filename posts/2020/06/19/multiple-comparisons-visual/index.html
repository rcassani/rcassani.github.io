          <p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem">multiple statistical comparison</a> are simultaneously performed, the risk of discovering false statistical significance increases as the number of comparisons increases. As such, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction">Bonferroni correction</a> is a commonly used method to address this multiple comparisons problem. In this post provides a visual demonstration to show why the multiple comparison problem is presented and needs to be addressed. The demonstration is based on theoretical and experimental results, and with it I hope the multiple comparisons problem will look more intuitive and understandable. All the codes to generate the results and figures in this post can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/rcassani/cbc395e9092d2088782fedb9154bf6ee">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-groups">Comparing groups<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-groups" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>Let's have two <strong>populations</strong> or <strong>random variables</strong> (RV) <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>. We want to evaluate if the means of these populations are significantly different. In other words, we want to perform an <strong>hypothesis test</strong> to determine if there is a <strong>significant difference between their means</strong> which are <span class="math">\(\mu_X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mu_Y\)</span> respectively. In most of the cases, there is not have access to all the realizations of the RVs, as such the hypothesis test is performed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)">statistical samples</a> (data) that are obtained by sampling the RVs, this is to say, by performing an experiment. Two hypothesis are considered: one <strong>null hypothesis</strong> <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> (there is no difference between means), and one <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> <span class="math">\(H_1\)</span> (there is difference between means), these are formulated as:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\mu_X = \mu_Y\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\mu_X - \mu_Y = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(H_1\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\mu_X \neq \mu_Y\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\mu_X - \mu_Y \neq 0\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>It is concluded that there is a <strong>significant difference</strong> in the population means, <strong><span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> is rejected</strong>, if there probability of having a difference between means at least or larger than the observed from the data is smaller than the <strong>significance level</strong> or <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. Otherwise, <strong><span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> is NOT rejected</strong> based on the available data. A commonly used value for <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is 0.05 (this is to say 5%).</p>
<p>To demonstrate the effects of multiple comparisons, the same the same hypothesis test will be tested in two scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>One comparison:</strong> <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> are described as univariate or single RV.</li>
<li><strong>Two or more comparisons:</strong> <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> are described as multivariate RV.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> when <span class="math">\(n\)</span> sample points are obtained from a normal distributed RV <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, we obtain the sample <span class="math">\(w\)</span> which consists of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> realizations of <span class="math">\(W\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is large, usually above 30, by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers (LLN)</a> the mean of <span class="math">\(w\)</span> or <strong>sample mean</strong> (<span class="math">\(\bar{w}\)</span>) is a good estimation of <span class="math">\(\mu_W\)</span>. Also for large values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, again usually over 30, the standard deviation of <span class="math">\(w\)</span> or <strong>sample standard deviation</strong> (<span class="math">\(s_w\)</span>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbiased_estimation_of_standard_deviation#Results_for_the_normal_distribution">good estimation of the standard deviation</a> of the population (<span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span>)</p>
<h3 id="1-one-comparison">1. One comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#1-one-comparison" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>To begin, let's assume the <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> is true, there is no difference between <span class="math">\(\mu_X - \mu_Y\)</span>. Indeed, let's assume that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> follow the same distribution, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Standard_normal_distribution">standard normal distribution</a> <span class="math">\(\mathcal{N}(\mu=0,\sigma^{2}=1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To test the <strong>difference between the population means</strong>, were are interested in the <strong>sampling distributions of the sample means</strong>. Thus, let's consider two new RVs: <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bar{Y}\)</span>, which are the <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/2/sampling_distributions/samp_dist_mean.html">sampling distribution of the sample mean</a> for the populations <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> respectively. The mean and standard deviation of these sampling distributions of the sample means are: <span class="math">\(\mu_\bar{X} = \mu_X\)</span> (remember that <span class="math">\(\mu_X = \bar{x}\)</span>), and <span class="math">\(\sigma_\bar{X} = \sigma_X/n\)</span> (remember that <span class="math">\(\sigma_X = s_x\)</span>). The same goes for <span class="math">\(\mu_\bar{Y}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma_\bar{Y}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, lets have another RV called <span class="math">\(Z = \bar{X} - \bar{Y}\)</span>. As <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bar{Y}\)</span> are normally distributed, <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is also normally distributed with <span class="math">\(\mu_Z = \mu_\bar{X} - \mu_\bar{Y}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma^2_Z = \sigma^2_\bar{X} + \sigma^2_\bar{Y}\)</span>. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Combination_of_two_independent_random_variables">link</a>.</p>
<p>The difference in <span class="math">\(\mu_X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mu_Y\)</span> will be considered significant if it has an occurring probability of 5% or less. As such from the normal distribution of <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, we can identify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">standard score (or z-score)</a> for this probability, this means that the difference is significant when is absolute value is larger than <span class="math">\(1.96\sigma_Z\)</span>. As <strong>95%</strong> of the values are between -<span class="math">\(1.96\sigma_Z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1.96\sigma_Z\)</span>.</p>
<p><center>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score#/media/File:The_Normal_Distribution.svg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/The_Normal_Distribution.svg" style="width: 700px;"></a><br>
<em>Probabilities and standard scores for normal distribution.</em>
</center></p>
<p>All this is to say, just by chance there is a probability of 5% or less that the absolute difference between <span class="math">\(\mu_X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mu_Y\)</span> is larger than <span class="math">\(1.96\sigma_Z\)</span>. To verify this in the simulation, 10,000 samplings were done to <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, each sample consisting in 100 sample points. The graph below presents the theoretical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function"><strong>probability density function</strong></a> (pdf) for <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, and the empiric pdf obtained from the simulation.</p>
<p><center>

<em>Probability distribution for <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>. Solid line: theoretical results. Shaded area: simulation results.</em><br>
<strong>Theoretical:</strong> <span class="math">\(P(|Z|&gt;1.96\sigma_Z) = 0.05\)</span> <br>
<strong>Experimental:</strong> <span class="math">\(P(|Z|&gt;1.96\sigma_Z) = 0.0475\)</span>
</center></p>
<p>So far so good, the null hypothesis is rejected around 5% of the time. But the problems start with multiple comparisons.</p>
<h3 id="2-two-or-more-comparisons">2. Two or more comparisons<a class="headerlink" href="#2-two-or-more-comparisons" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>Again, let's assume the null hypothesis is true. Thus, in this scenario, each population (<span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>) is characterized by a set of two independent RVs, which have a standard normal distribution. As the variables are independent and normally distributed, the covariance matrix for <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is a diagonal full with the variance of variable, in this case 1. This is to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(X = [X_1, X_2],\)</span> with <span class="math">\(X_1\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{X_1}=0,\sigma_{X_1}^{2}=1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X_2\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{X_2}=0,\sigma_{X_2}^{2}=1)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(Y = [Y_1, Y_2],\)</span> with <span class="math">\(Y_1\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{Y_1}=0,\sigma_{Y_1}^{2}=1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y_2\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{Y_2}=0,\sigma_{Y_2}^{2}=1)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's follow the same approach as in the <a href="#1-one-comparison">one-comparison section</a> for each of the two comparisons: <span class="math">\(X_1\)</span> vs <span class="math">\(Y_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X_2\)</span> vs <span class="math">\(Y_2\)</span>. Let's define a third bivariate RV, <span class="math">\(Z = [Z_1, Z_2]\)</span> with <span class="math">\(Z_1=X_1-Y_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Z_2=X_2-Y_2\)</span>. A difference in means would be considered significant if it has an occurring probability of of 5% or less; this means that the difference is significant when <span class="math">\(|Z_1| &gt; 1.96\sigma_{Z_1}\)</span> <strong>OR</strong> <span class="math">\(|Z_2| &gt; 1.96\sigma_{Z_2}\)</span>. The figure below shows the pdf of <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, with the marginal pdf for <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><center>
<a href="/images/two_comparisons.png"><img src="/images/two_comparisons.png" style="width: 800px;"></a><br>
<em>pdf of <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, marginal pdf for <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\pm1.96\sigma_{Z_1}\)</span> indicated as dotted red lines, and pdf for <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\pm1.96\sigma_{Z_2}\)</span> indicated as dotted red lines.</em>
</center></p>
<p>The pdf for <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is a surface where the total volume under the surface is equal to 1. By analyzing the pdf of Z and the marginal pdfs for <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span>, we can see that the box inside the red walls represents the probability that <span class="math">\(|Z_1| &lt; 1.96\sigma_{Z_1}\)</span> <strong>AND</strong> <span class="math">\(|Z_2| &lt; 1.96\sigma_{Z_2}\)</span>, as <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span> are independent, this can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(P(Z\)</span> <em>is inside red box</em><span class="math">\()\)</span> = <span class="math">\(P(|Z_1| &lt; 1.96\sigma_{Z_1})\)</span> <span class="math">\(P(|Z_2| &lt; 1.96\sigma_{Z_2})\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(P(Z\)</span> <em>is inside red box</em><span class="math">\()\)</span> = <span class="math">\(0.95*0.95 = 0.9025\)</span></p>
<p>This result can be rephrasing as: finding a significant result in <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> <em>OR</em> <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span>, is equal to 1 minus the probability of not finding a significant results for <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> nor for <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span>. Then the problem the multiple simultaneous comparisons is evident, as there is a probability of <strong>9.75%</strong> of finding a significant result in <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(Z_2\)</span> just by chance. Which is higher to the 5% probability deduced in the <a href="#1-one-comparison">one comparison</a> case. This is extended for <span class="math">\(m\)</span> multiple comparisons as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(P\)</span>(<em>finding at least one significant result</em><span class="math">\() = 1 - (1-\alpha)^m\)</span></p>
<p>The possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis, or finding a significant results just by chance, gets larger the more comparisons are performed simultaneously.</p>
<p>To address this problem, a common method used is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction">Bonferroni correction</a>. In this method, the significance level is adjusted to compensate for the increment in the probability of finding at least one significant result. As such the corrected significance level is <span class="math">\(\alpha/m\)</span> for a desired significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> in <span class="math">\(m\)</span> multiple comparisons.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Getting back to the bivariate RV, the regions obtained by using the significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\alpha/m\)</span> are shown below. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">standard score (or z-score)</a> for the corrected significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha/m\)</span> is 2.24. Moreover, the theoretical results are compared with the one from the simulation, where 10,000 samplings were done to <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, each sample consisting in 100 sample points.</p>
